# Medical_DataExtraction_OCR_Project
This project extracts medical data by converting PDFs to images using `pdf2image`, enhancing clarity with OpenCV thresholding, and extracting text via `pytesseract`. `Regex` structures the data into variables, and `FastAPI` serves the processed information, ensuring efficient retrieval of patient details or prescriptions.
